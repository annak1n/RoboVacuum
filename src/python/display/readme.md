# Display manage
The idea for this is to have a "display server" which interfaces with the papirus. The PaPirus has a low update speed so some infomration send to the screen will be out of date when the refersh arrives. The uses of a dequeue allows only the values on the right to be poped and after the update it clears the cache.

Another idea to be implemented is to have "tags" on the messages, allowing the display server to be set to filter fo a tag, and ignore the others.

Finally as the "radar rotations" and maps generated by navigation will be interested to see in real time the messages should be either strings or images. I think easiest would be that they are "always strings" but with a certain image tage the char array is reshaped to a rectange and printed to the screen.
